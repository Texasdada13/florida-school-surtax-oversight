## Elevator Pitches

### 10-Second Pitch
"We bring institutional-grade AI to taxpayer oversight—the same technology Wall Street uses to track billions now helps oversight committees track surtax and bond dollars."

### 30-Second Pitch
"Citizen oversight committees are responsible for tracking millions in voter-approved funds, but they're stuck with spreadsheets and monthly PDF reports. We've built an AI-powered dashboard that gives committee members instant answers in plain English, flags issues before they escalate, and provides full public transparency. Marion County went from catching problems months late to detecting them immediately."

### 60-Second Pitch
"Here's the challenge: Voters approved hundreds of millions for school construction, infrastructure, or public safety. Now a citizen committee is responsible for making sure that money is spent properly.

But they're overwhelmed. Data is scattered across spreadsheets and emails. Issues are discovered months too late. Meeting prep takes hours.

We've built an AI-powered oversight dashboard that solves this. Committee members ask questions in plain English—'How much have we spent on HVAC projects?'—and get instant answers. The system automatically flags projects that are over budget or behind schedule. And there's a public portal so citizens can see exactly where their tax dollars go.

Marion County's oversight committee went from 38% data accuracy to 100%, detected delays immediately instead of months later, and reduced meeting prep from hours to minutes.

Would you be open to a conversation about how this could work for your oversight committee?"

## Discovery Questions

### Opening Questions
- "Tell me about your oversight responsibilities. What projects are you tracking?"
- "How do you currently get updates on project status?"
- "What happens when a committee member asks a question in a meeting?"

### Pain Point Questions

**For School District Surtax Committees:**
- "How many projects are you tracking? How much total funding?"
- "How long before the committee typically learns about a project running over budget?"
- "How much time does staff spend preparing for each committee meeting?"
- "What happens when data in your reports doesn't match what contractors tell you?"

**For County/City Bond Oversight:**
- "How do you track progress across multiple departments and project managers?"
- "When was the last time you were surprised by a project delay or cost overrun?"
- "How do citizens currently get information about how bond money is being spent?"
- "What's your biggest compliance concern with the bond requirements?"

**For Special Districts:**
- "How do you demonstrate accountability to voters who approved the funding?"
- "What's your current process for flagging issues to the board?"
- "How confident are you that you'd catch a problem before it becomes public?"

### Quantification Questions
- "How many projects had budget overruns last year? What was the total?"
- "How many staff hours go into meeting preparation?"
- "What's the cost when an issue isn't caught until months after it starts?"
- "If a project goes 20% over budget, what's that in real dollars?"

### Decision Process Questions
- "Who would need to approve a system like this?"
- "Is there budget allocated for oversight tools, or would this need special approval?"
- "What's your timeline for addressing these challenges?"
- "Have you looked at other solutions? What did you find?"

---

## Objection Handling

### "We're already using spreadsheets and it works fine"

**Response:**
"Spreadsheets are great for storing data, but they can't do what our system does:
- Answer questions in plain English instantly
- Automatically flag issues when they exceed thresholds
- Provide real-time public transparency

Marion County was using spreadsheets too. They had 28 projects where no one knew which school they were at. Our AI figured out every single one automatically.

The question isn't whether spreadsheets work—it's whether you're catching issues as early as you could be. Can I show you what you might be missing?"

---

### "Our data isn't clean enough"

**Response:**
"That's actually a problem we solve, not a requirement we have.

Marion County had 38% of their school name fields blank or incorrect. Our AI school mapping service cleaned that up to 100% automatically—no manual data entry.

Part of our discovery process is assessing your data and designing a solution that works with what you have. We've never found a situation where the data was too messy to start. Would a data assessment help?"

---

### "We don't have budget for this"

**Response:**
"I understand budget is tight. Can I ask—what's it costing you now?

If staff spends 4-6 hours preparing for each meeting, that's real money. If a $2M project goes 45 days behind schedule before anyone notices, that's real risk.

Our implementation typically runs $25,000-75,000, with annual operations of $12,000-36,000. But most clients find the staff time savings alone cover the cost in the first year.

Would it help to see an ROI analysis for your specific situation?"

---

### "We're concerned about AI making decisions for us"

**Response:**
"That's a great concern to raise, and it's core to how we designed the system.

Our AI doesn't make decisions—it makes information accessible. It answers questions. It flags potential issues. But humans always make the decisions.

When the system says 'This project is 32 days behind schedule,' the committee decides what to do about it. The AI just makes sure you know about it immediately instead of finding out months later.

Does that address your concern?"

---

### "What about public records and sunshine law compliance?"

**Response:**
"We built this specifically for Florida's sunshine requirements.

- All data is exportable in standard formats
- Complete audit trails for every change
- Public portal requires no login
- Meeting-ready reports generate automatically

In fact, our public portal actually improves your transparency posture. Citizens can see project status, budgets, and spending without filing a public records request.

Would you like to see how the public portal works?"

---

### "We've tried technology solutions before and they failed"

**Response:**
"What happened? [Listen carefully]

Most oversight tools fail because they're built for project management, not public accountability. They're designed for contractors, not committees.

We built this specifically for citizen oversight:
- Questions answered in plain English, not technical reports
- Automatic alerts based on thresholds you define
- Public transparency built in from day one
- 8-week implementation, not months

Marion County was skeptical too. They ran our system in parallel with their existing process for a week before fully switching over. Would that kind of validation approach work for you?"

---

### "Can you integrate with our existing systems?"

**Response:**
"Yes—integration is core to our approach.

We've connected with:
- Financial/ERP systems for budget data
- Project management tools for schedule updates
- Document repositories for contracts and invoices
- Public vendor databases like Florida EDR

We don't require you to change your existing systems. We pull data from them and add the AI layer on top.

What systems are you currently using for project tracking?"

---

### "Why should we trust a smaller company with this?"

**Response:**
"Fair question. Here's why our size is actually an advantage:

1. **Focused expertise**: This is all we do. We're not spreading attention across hundreds of products.
2. **Direct access**: You work with the people who built the system, not a support queue.
3. **Proven results**: Marion County's committee went from reactive to proactive in 8 weeks.
4. **Lower risk**: Our pilot approach lets you validate before committing.

The big consulting firms would charge you $500K for a strategy deck. We deliver a working system for a fraction of that.

Would references from similar organizations help?"
