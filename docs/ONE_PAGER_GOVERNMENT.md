# AI-Powered Surtax & Bond Oversight
## For School Districts, Cities, and Counties

---

### The Challenge

Voters approve billions in bonds and surtaxes. Oversight committees struggle to track it all.

- **38%** of project records have incomplete or incorrect school/facility names
- **2-3 months** typical delay before budget overruns or schedule delays are detected
- **4-6 hours** manual data gathering before each oversight meeting
- **Limited visibility** for citizens who approved the funding

---

### Our Solution
