## Cold Outreach

### Template 1: The Problem Opener (School District Surtax)

**Subject:** Quick question about [District]'s surtax oversight

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [District] voters approved a surtax for school construction—congratulations on the community support.

Quick question: How quickly does your oversight committee learn when a project is behind schedule or over budget?

Most committees discover problems 2-3 months after they start. By then, options are limited.

We've built an AI-powered dashboard that flags issues immediately. Marion County's committee went from reactive to proactive—detecting delays the day they happen, not months later.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

[Your Name]

P.S. Here's Marion County's story: [Link to case study]

### Template 2: The Problem Opener (County Bond Oversight)

**Subject:** [County]'s bond accountability challenge

Hi [First Name],

I saw [County] issued bonds for [infrastructure/public safety/parks]. That's a significant commitment to voters—and a significant accountability responsibility.

Question: How do you currently demonstrate to citizens where that money is going?

Most counties struggle with scattered data, delayed reports, and limited public visibility. Our AI-powered oversight dashboard solves this by:

- Answering questions in plain English ("How much have we spent on bridge repairs?")
- Automatically flagging projects over budget or behind schedule
- Providing a public transparency portal for citizens

Marion County's oversight committee reduced meeting prep from 4-6 hours to 15 minutes.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how this could work for [County]?

### Template 3: The Trigger Event (New Surtax/Bond Approval)

**Subject:** Saw [District]'s surtax approval - timing question

Hi [First Name],

Congratulations on the [surtax/bond] approval! [Amount] for [purpose] is a strong vote of confidence from the community.

Now comes the hard part: tracking it all.

I work with oversight committees that are responsible for monitoring millions in voter-approved funds. The ones who set up proper tracking early avoid the problems that come later.

We've built an AI-powered oversight system that:
- Provides a single dashboard for all projects
- Answers committee questions in plain English
- Automatically flags delays and budget issues
- Gives citizens a transparency portal

Marion County implemented our system in 8 weeks. Happy to share what they learned.

Worth a conversation before the first projects kick off?

[Your Name]

### Template 4: The Mutual Connection (Reference from Another District)

**Subject:** [Name] at [Other District] suggested I reach out

Hi [First Name],

[Name] from [Other District] mentioned you're on the surtax oversight committee for [District].

[He/She] thought you might be interested in what we've built—an AI-powered dashboard that helps oversight committees track projects without the manual data gathering.

[Name] specifically mentioned that your committee was struggling with [specific challenge if known].

We helped Marion County solve similar issues. They went from catching problems months late to detecting them immediately.

Would you have 20 minutes this week to see how it works?

[Your Name]

### Template 5: The Value-First (Content-Based)

**Subject:** Resource: Surtax Oversight Best Practices Guide

Hi [First Name],

I put together a guide on how school district oversight committees are using AI to track voter-approved funds. No pitch—just practical insights from real implementations.

[Link to resource]

Key takeaway: The committees seeing the best results focus on three things:
1. Single source of truth (no more scattered spreadsheets)
2. Automated alerts (catch issues early)
3. Public transparency (build trust with voters)

If you want to discuss how this might apply to [District]'s committee, I'm happy to chat. But the guide is yours regardless.

### Template 6: The Sunshine Law Angle

**Subject:** Sunshine compliance for [District]'s surtax oversight

Hi [First Name],

Florida's sunshine laws require public transparency—but most oversight committees struggle to make their data accessible to citizens.

We've built a solution that solves this: a public portal where anyone can see project status, budgets, and spending without filing a public records request.

Marion County's committee loves it. They went from fielding individual records requests to pointing citizens to a real-time dashboard.

The system also:
- Answers committee questions in plain English
- Automatically flags delays and budget variances
- Generates meeting-ready reports

Worth a conversation about how this could help [District]?

[Your Name]

## Follow-Up Sequences

### Sequence 1: After No Response (3 emails)

**Email 1 (Day 3):**

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to make sure this didn't get buried.

The key thing Marion County's committee loved: asking questions in plain English.

"How much have we spent on HVAC projects?" The system answers immediately. No data gathering. No waiting for staff reports.

Worth exploring?

[Your Name]

---

**Email 2 (Day 7):**

**Subject:** Different question

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a couple times about AI-powered oversight. Maybe that's not the right fit.

Curious—what's the biggest challenge your oversight committee faces?

Even if we're not the right solution, I might be able to point you in a helpful direction.

[Your Name]

---

**Email 3 (Day 14):**

**Subject:** Closing the loop

Hi [First Name],

I'll take the hint—this probably isn't the right time.

I'll stop reaching out, but if [District]'s oversight committee ever needs help with:
- Real-time project tracking
- Automatic delay/budget alerts
- Public transparency portals

Feel free to reach out. I'm here when the timing is right.

[Your Name]

P.S. One thing before I go: Committees that catch issues early save an average of 15-20% on cost escalation. Something to keep in mind.

## Nurture Campaigns

### Template: Monthly Value Email (Oversight Best Practices)

**Subject:** [Month] oversight insight: Early warning systems

Hi [First Name],

Hope [District/County]'s oversight work is going well. Wanted to share something we're seeing across committees:

**Trend:** The most effective committees are moving from monthly reporting to real-time dashboards. The shift from "What happened last month?" to "What's happening now?" changes everything.

**Stat:** Projects where delays are caught in the first 30 days cost 15-20% less to remediate than those caught at 90 days.

**Quick win:** Ask your staff to flag any project that's 10% behind schedule—not just 30%. Early awareness creates more options.

We recently helped Marion County implement this approach. [Link to case study]

If real-time oversight is on your radar, let me know. Happy to share what we're learning.

[Your Name]

### Template: Content Share (Florida Sunshine Update)

**Subject:** Thought you'd find this useful - sunshine compliance

Hi [First Name],

Came across this update on Florida public records requirements and thought of you:

[Link]

The part about electronic records and citizen access is especially relevant for oversight committees.

Key takeaway: Proactive transparency (public portals) reduces records requests and builds public trust.

Let me know if you want to discuss how this applies to [District/County]'s oversight.

[Your Name]

---

### Template: Check-In (Post-Meeting Season)

**Subject:** How did [quarter/year] oversight meetings go?

Hi [First Name],

You mentioned your committee meets [frequency]. Curious how the recent meetings went.

Any surprises? Challenges? Wins?

No agenda here—just genuinely curious about what's working for oversight committees.

[Your Name]

### Template: Re-Engagement

**Subject:** Things change - checking in

Hi [First Name],

It's been a few months since we talked about AI-powered oversight for [District/County]. I know timing wasn't right back then.

Curious if anything has changed:
- New surtax or bond on the ballot?
- Committee composition changes?
- New challenges with current tracking?

If oversight data management is still on your radar, we've made some improvements I'd love to share:
- Faster implementation (6 weeks for smaller portfolios)
- Enhanced public portal features
- New document attachment capabilities

Worth a quick call?

[Your Name]

### Template: Budget Cycle Timing

**Subject:** Budget season - oversight technology

Hi [First Name],

If you're like most districts, budget discussions are happening now for next fiscal year.

Quick thought: AI-powered oversight typically costs $25-75K to implement, with $12-36K annual operations. Most committees fund this from surtax administrative allocations.

ROI typically comes from:
- Staff time savings (85% less manual tracking)
- Earlier issue detection (avoiding cost escalation)
- Improved vendor accountability

If this is something worth including in budget discussions, I'm happy to provide detailed projections for [District/County].

Let me know.

## Reference Requests

### Template: Ask for Reference Call

**Subject:** Quick favor - reference call?

Hi [First Name],

I hope all is well at [District/County]!

I'm in late-stage conversations with [Prospect District/County], and they'd like to speak with an oversight committee that has implemented our dashboard.

Would you be willing to take a 15-minute call with them?

I'd brief you beforehand on what they're interested in, and of course would never share anything confidential about your implementation.

Totally understand if timing doesn't work. Either way, appreciate you considering it.

## Event-Triggered Templates

### Template: After Bond/Surtax Election

**Subject:** Congratulations on the [surtax/bond] approval!

Hi [First Name],

Saw the news about [District/County]'s [surtax/bond] approval—congratulations!

$[Amount] for [purpose] is a significant commitment from voters. Now the accountability clock starts.

One thing we've learned working with oversight committees: The earlier you set up proper tracking, the smoother everything goes. Committees that wait until problems emerge have fewer options.

We help oversight committees track voter-approved funds with AI-powered dashboards. Marion County implemented our system before their first projects started and never had to play catch-up.

Worth a conversation about setting up [District/County] for success?

[Your Name]

---

### Template: After Audit Finding or News Story

**Subject:** Saw the [audit finding/news story] about [District/County]

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [brief, neutral reference to the issue—no judgment].

These situations are tough. Oversight committees often inherit problems they didn't create.

If you're looking to improve visibility and demonstrate accountability going forward, we've helped committees implement AI-powered tracking that:
- Provides real-time visibility into all projects
- Automatically flags issues at configurable thresholds
- Creates complete audit trails
- Gives the public a transparency portal

Happy to discuss how this might help—or just share what other committees have done in similar situations.

[Your Name]

### Template: Committee Member Change

**Subject:** Welcome to [District]'s oversight committee

Hi [First Name],

I saw you've joined [District]'s surtax oversight committee—welcome!

As a new committee member, you're probably getting up to speed on [X] projects and $[X]M in tracking responsibility. That's a lot to absorb.

We've built an AI-powered dashboard that makes oversight easier:
- Ask questions in plain English ("What's the status of the Forest High project?")
- Automatic alerts when projects exceed thresholds
- Public portal for citizen transparency

Marion County's committee found it especially valuable for new members getting up to speed.

Would a quick overview be helpful as you settle into the role?
