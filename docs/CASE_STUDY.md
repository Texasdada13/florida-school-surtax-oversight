## The Challenge

### Background

Marion County voters approved a 0.5% sales surtax in 2024 to fund K-12 school construction and renovation over 10 years. The citizen oversight committee needed to track $450M in taxpayer funds across 45+ projects at 40+ schools—with complete transparency and accountability.

Marion County Public Schools faced several challenges common to surtax oversight:

### Pain Points

- **Scattered Information:** Project data lived in spreadsheets, PDFs, and emails across multiple departments. No single source of truth existed.

- **Manual Tracking:** Committee members spent hours before each meeting gathering updates, with no automated flagging of problems.

- **Delayed Detection:** Budget overruns and schedule delays were often discovered months after they began, limiting corrective action options.

- **Public Accountability:** Florida's sunshine laws require transparency, but raw data wasn't accessible to citizens in a meaningful way.

### The Breaking Point

> *"We were 6 months into a $2M project before anyone noticed it was 45 days behind schedule. By then, our options were limited. We needed a system that would catch these issues early."*
> — Oversight Committee Member

### Previous Attempts

Before engaging our team, the committee had tried:
- **Spreadsheet tracking** — Became outdated within days; no automated alerts
- **Monthly PDF reports** — Information overload; buried critical issues in 50+ pages
- **Vendor portals** — Contractor-controlled data; lacked independent verification

---

## The Solution

### Discovery Phase

Our team spent 2 weeks understanding the committee's needs:

- Interviewed oversight committee members and school district staff
- Analyzed existing project data and reporting processes
- Mapped Florida surtax compliance requirements
- Identified quick wins and automation opportunities

### Solution Design

Based on our assessment, we designed a solution that:

1. **Unified Dashboard:** Single source of truth for all surtax-funded projects with real-time status
2. **AI-Powered Q&A:** Natural language interface so committee members can ask questions in plain English
3. **Automated Alerts:** Instant flagging when projects exceed 30-day delays or 10% budget variance
4. **Public Portal:** Citizen-facing transparency view meeting Florida sunshine requirements

### Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Discovery | 2 weeks | Requirements, data audit, compliance review |
| Development | 4 weeks | Dashboard build, AI training, integration |
| Testing | 1 week | Parallel validation with manual tracking |
| Deployment | 1 week | Launch, committee training, documentation |
| Optimization | Ongoing | Monthly refinements, new feature requests |

## The Results

### Quantitative Outcomes

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| School name accuracy | 38% (manual) | 100% (auto) | +163% |
| Time to detect delays | 2-3 months | Immediate | -100% |
| Meeting prep time | 4-6 hours | 15 minutes | -96% |
| Data refresh frequency | Monthly | Real-time | Continuous |
| Projects with risk flags | Unknown | 10 (flagged) | Full visibility |

### Operational Impact

**Before:**
- Committee members manually compiled data from multiple sources
- Issues discovered reactively, often too late for intervention
- Citizens had no easy way to view surtax spending

**After:**
- Single dashboard shows all 45 projects with current status
- AI flags concerns automatically as they emerge
- Public portal provides full transparency to taxpayers

### Compliance Impact

- **100%** of projects tracked with standardized categories
- **100%** capital vs. operating classification maintained
- **Complete audit trail** of all project changes
- **Exportable reports** for statutory requirements

### Qualitative Outcomes

Beyond the numbers, the committee experienced:

- **Confidence in Meetings:** Questions answered instantly with AI interface
- **Proactive Governance:** Problems flagged before they escalate
- **Public Trust:** Citizens can verify surtax spending independently
- **Staff Efficiency:** District staff freed from repetitive reporting

## Client Testimonials

> *"For the first time, I can walk into a committee meeting and answer any question immediately. 'How much have we spent on HVAC projects?' I just ask the system. It changes everything."*
> — Committee Chair

> *"The automatic school name mapping alone saved us dozens of hours. We had 28 projects listed as 'N/A' for school—the AI figured out every single one."*
> — District Facilities Manager

> *"Taxpayers approved this surtax. They deserve to see where their money goes. The public portal makes that possible."*
> — School Board Member

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **Start with the Executive Persona:** Designing for time-starved committee members forced us to prioritize clarity over features
- **Natural Language First:** The AI Q&A became the most-used feature—executives prefer asking questions to navigating dashboards
- **Automatic Data Quality:** The school mapping service eliminated 100% of "Unknown School" records without manual intervention

### Challenges Overcome

- **Legacy Data Formats:** Historical project data existed in inconsistent formats. We built normalization scripts that standardized everything automatically.
- **Real-Time Sync Concerns:** District staff worried about data currency. We implemented visual "last updated" timestamps on every metric to build confidence.

### Recommendations for Similar Projects

Based on this engagement, we recommend:

1. **Define "Red Flags" Upfront:** Agree on specific thresholds (30 days late, 10% over budget) before building alerts
2. **Include Public Portal from Day One:** Transparency features build trust with oversight committees and constituents
3. **Train on Real Questions:** Use actual committee meeting questions to validate the AI Q&A system

## What's Next

Since the initial deployment, Marion County has:

- **Added Document Management:** Upload and track contracts, invoices, and progress photos
- **Enabled Email Alerts:** Automatic notifications to committee members when issues arise
- **Expanded Vendor Analytics:** Performance scoring to inform future contractor selection
- **Planned Multi-County Expansion:** Template system designed for rollout to neighboring counties

### Marion County Schools: AI Surtax Oversight Case Study

**Challenge:** Marion County's citizen oversight committee needed to track $156M in surtax-funded school construction across 45 projects. Data was scattered, delays went undetected for months, and manual reporting consumed hours of staff time.

**Solution:** We implemented an AI-powered dashboard with natural language Q&A, automated risk detection, and a public transparency portal.

**Results:**
- **100%** school name auto-mapping (was 38% manual accuracy)
- **Immediate** delay detection (was 2-3 months)
- **15 minutes** meeting prep (was 4-6 hours)
- **Full public transparency** via citizen portal

**Quote:**
> *"I can walk into a meeting and answer any question immediately. It changes everything."*
> — Committee Chair
