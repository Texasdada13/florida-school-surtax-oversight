## SLIDE 2: The Oversight Gap

### The Problem: Accountability Struggles with Scale

**Left side - What Voters Approved:**
- $450M in school surtax funds
- 45+ construction projects
- 40+ school facilities
- 10-year accountability commitment

**Right side - What Oversight Committees Face:**
- Data scattered across spreadsheets and PDFs
- Issues discovered months too late
- Hours of manual prep for each meeting
- Limited public transparency

**Bottom text:**
*Citizen oversight committees are responsible for tracking millions—but lack the tools to do it effectively.*

**We're changing that.**

---

## SLIDE 3: Our Mission

### AI for Public Accountability

**Big text:**
> "The same technology that tracks billions on Wall Street should track taxpayer dollars in your community."

**Three pillars (icons):**
1. **Unified Visibility** - Single source of truth for all projects
2. **Intelligent Alerts** - Issues flagged before they escalate
3. **Public Transparency** - Sunshine law compliance built-in

## SLIDE 4: Proof Point - Marion County Schools

### Real Results, Real Data

**Screenshot/mockup of dashboard**

**Key Stats (in boxes):**
| 100% | 85% | 15 min | $156M |
|------|-----|--------|-------|
| School Name Auto-Mapping | Reduction in Manual Work | Meeting Prep (was 4-6 hrs) | Budget Under Oversight |

**Bottom text:**
*Marion County's surtax oversight committee now tracks 45 projects with immediate visibility into delays and budget issues.*

## SLIDE 5: How It Works

### AI-Powered Oversight Architecture

**Flow diagram:**

```
Data Sources              AI Engine                   Outputs
┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐        ┌────────────────┐
│ Project Data │───┐     │                  │        │                │

└──────────────┘         │                  │        │                │

                         └──────────────────┘        └────────────────┘
```

**Key point:**
*Committee members ask questions in plain English. The AI finds answers instantly.*

## SLIDE 6: Key Features

### Complete Oversight Toolkit

**Six feature boxes:**

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Unified Dashboard** | All projects, one view, real-time status |
| **AI Q&A Interface** | "How much have we spent on HVAC?" → Instant answer |
| **Automated Alerts** | Email when projects exceed 30-day or 10% thresholds |
| **School Name Mapping** | 100% data accuracy without manual cleanup |
| **Vendor Analytics** | Performance tracking across all contracts |
| **Public Portal** | Citizen transparency, sunshine compliance |

---

## SLIDE 7: The Before & After

### From Reactive to Proactive

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Data accuracy | 38% (manual) | 100% (auto) |
| Time to detect delays | 2-3 months | Immediate |
| Meeting prep time | 4-6 hours | 15 minutes |
| Data refresh frequency | Monthly | Real-time |
| Public visibility | None | Full portal |

**Key insight:**
*A project that was 45 days behind schedule was caught at day 1, not month 6.*

---

## SLIDE 8: AI-Powered Q&A

### Ask Questions in Plain English

**Example queries and responses:**

**"How much have we spent on HVAC projects?"**
> "HVAC projects total $8.2M across 12 contracts, with $5.1M spent to date (62% of budget)."

**"Which projects are behind schedule?"**
> "10 projects show schedule concerns. 3 are flagged red (>30 days behind), 7 are yellow (15-30 days)."

**"Show me all work at Forest High School"**
> "Forest High has 4 active projects: HVAC ($2.1M, 78% complete), Roof ($890K, 45% complete)..."

**Bottom text:**
*No training required. Ask questions like you would ask a colleague.*

---

## SLIDE 9: Automated Risk Detection

### Issues Flagged Before They Escalate

**Alert thresholds (configurable):**
- **Schedule:** Flag at 15 days late, escalate at 30 days
- **Budget:** Flag at 5% variance, escalate at 10%
- **Quality:** Pattern detection across vendor performance

**Alert workflow:**
```
Issue Detected → System Flags → Email Sent → Dashboard Updated → Committee Notified
```

**Key differentiator:**
*The system watches 24/7. Committee members focus on decisions, not data gathering.*

---

## SLIDE 10: Public Transparency Portal

---

## SLIDE 11: School Name Auto-Mapping

### 100% Data Quality Without Manual Cleanup

**The Problem:**
- Source data shows "HVAC Replacement Phase 2"
- No school name in the record
- Manual research required

**Our Solution:**
- AI extracts school names from contract titles
- Pattern matching against 50+ school database
- Handles variations: "Dunnellon High" → "Dunnellon Senior High School"

**Result:**
*28 contracts with missing school names were auto-populated with 100% accuracy.*
